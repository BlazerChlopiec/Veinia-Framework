TODO:
- remake the chunk system (finish ExecuteUpdateWhenCulled)
- (work around currently Time.StopForFrames()) when the game is loading it freezes but the gravity seems to still be increasing, the same is true for dragging a window
- (GeonBit.UI, maybe?) anchors break out the animation
- (GeonBit.UI, maybe?) images dont scale with GlobalScale
- (maybe?) rework the loader (merge it with level.cs?) to reduce global classes

Editor:
- Add ctrl+z
- Add layers like in gd
- Add single selection layering like in gd
- Add get painting prefab from single selection button
- Add Handles (rotation handle)
- deprecate EditorObjects and just replace them with gameobjects and add a ContextMenu to edit the objects individually in the editor (finish SerializeField)
- (maybe? )Procedural tilemap painting
- (maybe?) rework the grid (make it more performant)
- (maybe?) dynamically change grid size in the editor


Goals:
- aether physics implementation
- optimisation
- audio (library with volume and pitch)
- penumbra lights
- sprite animation
- particles
- Spritesheet Prefab Loading
- (maybe?) improve different gamepad support
