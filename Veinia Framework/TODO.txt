TODO:
- remake the chunk system
- finish ExecuteUpdateWhenCulled
- store levels instead of creating new levels every time
- a collider is currently pushable if its instantiated before the pusher which is weird
- add collision priority
- rework the grid (make it more performant)
- add editor gizmos
- save .veinia files in game directory
- check if render targets are compatible
- dynamically change grid size in the editor
- make an edit editor tab
- rework the loader (merge it with level.cs?) to reduce global classes
- (GeonBit.UI) anchors break out the animation
- (GeonBit.UI) images dont scale with GlobalScale
- if you're touching a non trigger collider the next collider even if its trigger will be considered non trigger


Goals:
- optimisation
- improve different gamepad support
- audio
- penumbra lights
- animation 
- particles




-DONE
- implement AddComponent()
- simplify gameobject/component syntax
- make a camera look at
- simplify veinia initialization (make it easy to implement)
- implement getting components in first frame (DONE, Initialized Components on the second frame)
- findobjectsoftype uses nullablegetcomponent which doesn't allow for duplicate components
- add RemoveComponent()
- add Time.stop
- Separate Physics into two scripts Collider.cs and Physics.cs
- Finding multiple components at a time
- remake prefabs
- framework prefab-based editor
- add editor toolbar
- implement Myra UI
- examine the need of utils.cs
- add OnCollide(state, info) & OnTrigger(state, info)
- rename pixelsPerUnit to unitSize and add a sprite property called pixelsPerUnit that scales textures accordingly
- add a unique desktop root to each level in level.cs
- merge worldtools.cs and level.cs
- add a collision rect screen size in veiniaInitializer's constructor
- added a Level reference to components
- added isEnabled to components
- mouse UI position gets weird when resizing the screen (GeonBit.UI)
- (GeonBit.UI) remove all ui when changing a scene 
- (GeonBit.UI) make a static bool which determines if mouse is hovering over any ui element
- (GeonBit.UI) add isPersistent (should be removed on scene change)
- (GeonBit.UI) fix global scaling turning off rich colors
