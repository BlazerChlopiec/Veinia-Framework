TODO:
- remake the chunk system
- finish ExecuteUpdateWhenCulled
- store levels instead of creating new levels every time
- a collider is currently pushable if its instantiated before the pusher which is weird
- add collision priority
- rework the grid (make it more performant)
- save .veinia files in game directory
- check if render targets are compatible
- dynamically change grid size in the editor
- make an edit editor tab
- rework the loader (merge it with level.cs?) to reduce global classes
- (GeonBit.UI) anchors break out the animation
- (GeonBit.UI) images dont scale with GlobalScale


Goals:
- have a lightweight phys engine (currently circle collider support is very bad)
- optimisation
- improve different gamepad support
- audio
- penumbra lights
- animation 
- particles
